## Mounting
The **Upper_Body** is mounted quite simply, four M3 screws attatched at the **Corner Posts** hold it in place. This is achieved by applying the same 6mm fillet as is applied to the **Corner Posts** and then placing a 3.75mm diameter hole, 3mm from the edge of the fillets center point.
<br>
<sub>Future revisions of the standard should consider a different solution, more data is needed to see the long term durability results, I am especially concerned about the corner posts snapping after a drop.
