## Overview

This subdirectory is dedicated to outlining the FF00-1 standard, this is not a completed build but rather the standards that all -1 builds should follow

<sub>See [the name](../README.md) for more information</sub>

As this is the intial standard there are many issues due to my oversight, it is for this reason that many aspects that should be standardized are left open. I chose this direction to allow for better solutions to emerge, which can be incorporated into future standards.
