## Overview

This subdirectory is dedicated to outlining the FF00-1 standard, this is not a completed build but rather the standards that all -1 builds should follow

<sub>See [the name](../README.md) for more information</sub>

As this is the intial standard there are many issues due to my oversight, my hope is that this revision will draw attention towards this project and hopefully get people far more talented then me to collaborate and help refine future standards. I myself am not a very experienced or good designer, but I believe the core of this project is solid and can serve as a foundation for future work.
