## Base
The walls of FF00-1 are 6mm thick, this was chosen as it allows for M3 heatset inserts to be placed in the **Corner Posts** and generally provides a good compromise between stability and space.

## Corner Posts

Pictured below, these serve as attatchment points for the [Upper_Body](../Upper_Body/outline.md) and hold the [Tray](../Tray/outline.md) in place.
