## Base
The walls of FF00-1 are 6mm thick, this was chosen as it allows for M3 heatset inserts to be placed in the **Corner Posts** and generally provides a good compromise between stability and space.

The inner area of the base is 4mm tall, while the wall edges are 6mm, this is to allow for locking extrusions, detailed in [Upper_Body](../FF00-1/Upper_Body/outline.md).

## Corner Posts

Pictured below, these serve as attatchment points for the [Upper_Body](../Upper_Body/outline.md) and hold the [Tray](../Tray/outline.md) in place.

The posts are placed in each corner of the **base**, attatched to the corner square and hugging the inner side are two 6mm long, 3mm wide rectangles.
