## Base
The **Walls** of FF00-1 are 6mm thick, this was chosen as it allows for M3 heatset inserts to be placed in the **Corner Posts** and generally provides a good compromise between stability and space.

<br>
<sub>Note: this image is from a prototype of FF14-1, the width and depth of the base are irrelevant here</sub>

<br>
<br>

The inner area of the **base** is 4mm tall, while the wall edges are 6mm, this is to allow for locking extrusions, detailed in [Upper_Body](../Upper_Body/outline.md)
<br>

## Corner Posts

Pictured below, these serve as attatchment points for the [Upper_Body](../Upper_Body/outline.md) and hold the [Tray](../Tray/outline.md) in place.

The posts are placed in each corner of the **base**, attatched to the corner square and hugging the inner side are two 6mm long, 3mm wide rectangles.

<br>

A 6mm fillet is applied to the outer edge of the **Corner Post** this is important to note as it affects the placement of the M3 heatset insert.

<br>
<br>

The extrusion placed for an M3 heatset insert lies in the center between the inner corner and the edge of the 6mm fillet. (Or 3mm from the inner corner)

<br>
<sub>The radius of the extrusion is dependent on the type of heatset insert used, 4mm was chosen here as it is compatible with commonly found 6mm long M3 inserts. Image taken from a prototype of FF14-1</sub>



## Middle Posts
The placement of the **Middle Posts** depends on the substandard, they serve as attatchment points for the tray. A single 6mm long, 3mm wide rectangle is placed along the inner wall edge.

<br>
<sub>The second image shows a 2mm tall extrusion running across the base, this is to allow for the tray to sit flat and will be detailed later. Images taken from a prototype of FF14-1.</sub>



## Walls
It is important to note that **Wall Height** and subsequently **Corner Post** and **Middle Post** height *may vary depending on substandard*
